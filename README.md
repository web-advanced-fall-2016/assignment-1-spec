# First Assignment Specification

## Assignment Specification
Each student should develop one user interface element ( What are UI elements? See [here](http://semantic-ui.com/modules/search.html)! ). You need to choose **one** of the following four options to develop as for your assignment. Go to each of their readme pages to find out about their requirements.
* [**A Slider/Carousel Element**](https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-spec/blob/master/README-SLIDER.md)
* [**An Accordion Element**](https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-spec/blob/master/README-ACCORDION.md)
* [**A Modal Element**](https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-spec/blob/master/README-MODAL.md)
* [**A Search Field Element With Dropdown for Suggestions From Static Data**](https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-spec/blob/master/README-SEARCH-SUGGESTION-DROPDOWN.md) (long name! sorry! it's simple tho)
 
If you were interested in developing other UI elements other than these four options, let me know and we'll make that work.

###BONUS POINTS
* Each option has its own bonus requirements.
* If you put together a demo page for your assignment when you are done developing it (something like [**THIS**](https://samantehrani.github.io/simple-carousel/)) it'll be a big bonus. It's just good presentation of your work and is great for own. Look here for [how to do so](https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/class-wiki/wiki/Create-a-GitHub-Project-Page-for-project's-demo).
* Make it look BEAUTIFUL

## Submission Details
All the submission must be done through github to our class organization [@web-advanced-fall-2016](https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016). The assignment will be accomodated and distributed using [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/). GitHub classroom will automatically create a repository in our organization for each student and will grant administrative rights of that repository to that student.    
All students **MUST** visit this url: [Confirmation Link](https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/2016637b1c5f5a01c2ef6f041bba4bb5). There you will be asked to accept and confirm the reception of the First Assignment and consequently a repository will be automatically created for you under our oranization. The name of your repository will follow the following pattern: `assignment-1-${your GitHub username}`.

Your new repository will start looking exactly like the current repository`assignment-1-spec`. So there will be four versions of README.md under the names of: `README-SLIDER.md`, `README-ACCORDION.md`, `README-MODAL.md`, `README-SEARCH-SUGGESTION-DROPDOWN.md`. Exactly like here now!    
In your own new assignment respository `https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-${your username}`, go on and delete README.md and replace it with the readme of your choice.    

#### Example
Just to show the what procedure is like, I created a new github account for an imaginary student (for test): his name is "Sample Student". This is his github profile link: [https://github.com/sample-student](https://github.com/sample-student). (while logged in as "Sample Student") Clicked on the aforementioned confirmation link. GitHub classroom automatically created this repository for him : [https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-sample-student](https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-sample-student). Then let's assume that "Sample Student" picked to develop `Accordion`. So, he removed all of the readme files except the one for accordion and added his information to it.
